#Polyglot is a open-source library support 130 languages
# Create a new text object using Polyglot's Text class: txt
txt = Text(article)

# Print each of the entities found
for ent in txt.entities:
    print(ent)
    
# Print the type of ent
print(type(ent))


#use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples, 
#in which the first element is the entity tag, 
#and the second element is the full string of the entity text.
# Create the list of tuples: entities
entities = [(ent.tag, ' '.join(ent)) for ent in txt.entities]

# Print entities
print(entities)


#You'll continue your exploration of polyglot now with some Spanish annotation. 
#This article is not written by a newspaper, so it is your first example of a more blog-like text. 
#How do you think that might compare when finding entities?
#Your specific task is to determine how many of the entities contain the words "Márquez" or "Gabo" 
#- these refer to the same person in different ways!
# Initialize the count variable: count
count = 0

# Iterate over all the entities
for ent in txt.entities:
    # Check whether the entity contains 'Márquez' or 'Gabo'
    if "Márquez" in ent or "Gabo" in ent:
        # Increment count
        count += 1

# Print count
print(count)

# Calculate the percentage of entities that refer to "Gabo": percentage
percentage = count / len(txt.entities)
print(percentage)
